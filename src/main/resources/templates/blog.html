                        <p>Growing up, I was mostly exposed to career paths like teaching, medicine, nursing, and engineering, among others. I never thought I would end up in the tech industry. But fast-forward a few years later, and here I am, a woman in tech.

                            Studying software engineering has been the most challenging thing I have ever done in my life. Working on a project for days and facing frustrating obstacles that prevent progress can be tough.
                            But the joy that comes with figuring things out and making things finally work is priceless.

                            I am grateful to be in a field that continuously challenges me, forces me to think outside the box, and learn new things.
                            The tech industry has had a profound impact on society, and its positive effects will continue to shape the world for years to come

                    Software Engineering is a challenging and constantly evolving field, which means there is always something new to learn. In order to succeed, it's important to be able to grasp new concepts quickly.
                    There will always be people who can learn faster and do things better than you. Therefore, it's crucial to maintain a positive mindset, avoid comparing yourself to others in the field, and remain confident and calm.

                    Instead of feeling intimidated by those who are more skilled, you should learn as much as you can from them and use that knowledge to improve. It's important to remember that not knowing something doesn't make you dumb,
                    and not understanding something today doesn't mean you won't understand it tomorrow.

                    By putting in the effort and wanting to understand specific topics, you can always improve and grow in the field of Software Engineering.

                        I have learned that it can teach us a lot about ourselves.
                        When we fail at something, it gives us a clear picture of our understanding
                        and highlights the areas
                        where we need to improve in order to do better next time.
                        How we respond to failure is crucial because it can either help us
                        grow and improve or hold us back.
                        If we allow ourselves to be traumatized by failure,
                        we may not be able to move past it and learn from our mistakes. </p>

                    <p class="card-text">As a developer, I am always looking for ways to improve myself. I constantly ask myself questions like 'What can I do differently?' and 'What can I incorporate into my way of doing things that can make me improve?'

                        One of the things that has been brought to my attention is the importance of writing down pseudocode and algorithms before jumping into coding on a computer. This is something I used to be ignorant about, but now I see how beneficial it can be.

                        In addition, I am teaching myself how to learn effectively using <a href="https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/" target="_blank">'The Feynman Learning Technique'.</a> This technique involves breaking down complex topics and explaining them in simple terms as if you were teaching them to someone else.
                        It has been a great tool in my personal growth as a developer.

                        ourselves and whether we belong. It's nice to have a coping mechanism that can keep you motivated. Staying positive when feeling small is important. Always remind yourself that you are amazing and continue to be confident.
